# Recursion-for-DSA

Welcome to the **Recursion-for-DSA** repository! This project is focused on learning and mastering recursion by solving problems of varying difficulty levels, starting from basic to intermediate. The repository is structured to make it easier for learners to navigate and contribute.

## ðŸ“– What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. Itâ€™s a crucial concept in algorithms and data structures and is widely used in solving problems involving divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and tree/graph traversals.

### Why Learn Recursion?
- Strengthens problem-solving skills.
- Helps in understanding key programming concepts.
- Provides a foundation for advanced algorithm design.
